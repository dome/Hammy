## Liquidity provision

To use the Liquidity provision service, navigate to the [Pools](https://hammy.finance/pool) page.

1. Connect your wallet to start your journey with Hammy.

2. Select the tokens you want to add liquidity to. You can provide liquidity for any pair of tokens supported on Hammy.

3. Specify the amount of each token you wish to deposit into the liquidity pool. If an existing pool for your selected token pair is available, Hammy will automatically calculate the appropriate amount for the corresponding token on the other side of the pair.
