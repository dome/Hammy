The XRPL EVM blockchain is a public, decentralized ledger. When you interact with the Hammy Swap protocol by connecting your wallet and conducting transactions, information such as your wallet address and transaction details are publicly accessible on the blockchain.

## 6. Data Security

We implement reasonable security measures to protect against unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction of your information. However, no method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. Therefore, we cannot guarantee absolute security.
