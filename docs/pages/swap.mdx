    display: "block",
    marginLeft: "7.5%",
    marginRight: "auto",
  }}
/>

2. Select your base token (the token you want to swap from) and the token you want to receive. In this example, we will swap from USDC to XRP.

3. Specify the amount you wish to exchange. The platform will automatically display the expected amount you will receive, taking into account current market conditions and liquidity pool depth. In this example, we are swapping 10 USDC for XRP.
