## Swap

To use the Swap service, navigate to the [Swap](https://hammy.finance/) page.

1. Connect your wallet to start your journey with Hammy.

2. Select your base token (the token you want to swap from) and the token you want to receive. In this example, we will swap from XXX to XXX.

3. Specify the amount you wish to exchange. The platform will automatically display the expected amount you will receive, taking into account current market conditions and liquidity pool depth.

4. If desired, you can adjust the slippage tolerance (set at 0.5% by default) and the deadline (set at 20 minutes by default).
