# XRP Integration

Hammy Swap is built to work seamlessly with XRP as the native currency, similar to how Ethereum DEXs work with ETH.

## XRP vs WXRP

### XRP (Native Token)
- **Symbol**: XRP
- **Type**: Native blockchain currency
- **Usage**: Used for gas fees and direct trading

### WXRP (Wrapped XRP)
- **Symbol**: WXRP  
- **Type**: ERC20-compatible wrapper contract
- **Usage**: Used in liquidity pools and DeFi protocols

## ⚠️ Important Restrictions

### Cannot Create XRP/WXRP Pools
The interface **prevents** creating liquidity pools between XRP and WXRP because:
- They represent the same underlying asset
- The conversion is always 1:1 via the WXRP contract
- No real liquidity provision would occur
- Could create user confusion

**✅ Instead**: Use the **Swap interface** to convert between XRP and WXRP at 1:1 ratio.

### XRP ↔ WXRP Swaps (Wrap/Unwrap)
Direct swaps between XRP and WXRP are **supported** and work as follows:
- **XRP → WXRP**: Uses `deposit()` function (wrapping)
- **WXRP → XRP**: Uses `withdraw()` function (unwrapping)  
- **Rate**: Always 1:1 (no slippage, no price impact)
- **Fees**: No fees for conversion
- **No approval needed**: XRP swaps don't require token approval

**✅ Use the Swap interface** for XRP ↔ WXRP conversions with a seamless experience.
